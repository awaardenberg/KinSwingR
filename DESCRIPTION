Description: KinSwingR integrates phosphosite data derived from mass-spectrometry
    data and kinase-substrate predictions to predict kinase activity. Several functions
    allow the user to build PWM models of kinase-subtrates, statistically infer PWM:substrate
    matches, and integrate these data to infer kinase activity.
